Pseudo code of the A* star algorithm looks like :

step 1- we first initialize the list called OpenList.

step 2- then we initialize the 2nd list which is ClosedList.

step 3- after that we check 

      while( OpenList != empty){  // while loop starts here.     

         then we find the least node say x from the OpenList and we name it as a;

          thereafter we do pop operation on a and then we close the OpenList;

           then we generate the 8 child of a and we call father to a, means a = father;

          Now for each child we do the following operation-// for loop starts here

         if(child == goal)

          then we stop searching here;

}

 now,we do the following-

child.goal = a.goal + the distance between the child and a;

child.x = distance from the goal to the child( the same can be done by implementing heuristic function also or we can do the same via Manhattan distance or by euclidean distance 

 then we do this

child.b = child . goal + child.x;



 we evaluate if  a node is having the exact same position as of child and that too in the OpenList  , that has a lower x than the child , then we just skip this child 



we check if a node is having the exact same position as of child and that is in the ClosedList, that has a lower x than the child , we now  skip the the child and we add this node in the OpenList ;

end; // for loop ends here.

step 4;

Now  pushing a in the ClosedList;

end ; // while loop ends here.
